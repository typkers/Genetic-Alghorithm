I wrote the main logic of the genetic algorithm, including:
CBestIndividual – Keeps track of the best solution found so far.
CGeneticAlgorithm – Runs the entire genetic algorithm, handling selection, crossover, mutation, and stopping conditions.
CIndividual – Represents a single solution with a genotype, fitness evaluation, mutation, and crossover functions.
Other supporting classes were provided by the professor as a framework, allowing me to focus on implementing the core algorithm.

Through this project, I got some hands-on experience with genetic algorithms, figuring out how to create and run an optimization process that gets better over time. 
It also helped me level up my C++ skills, especially with object-oriented programming, making algorithms run efficiently, and using randomness to approach problems in smarter ways.
